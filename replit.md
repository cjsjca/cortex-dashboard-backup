## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a single `memories` table with the following structure:
- `id`: UUID primary key (auto-generated)
- `content`: Text content of the conversation
- `embedding`: Array of real numbers (3072-dimensional vector from OpenAI)
- `metadata`: JSONB field for storing original messages, timestamps, etc.
- `createdAt`: Timestamp with default to current time

### API Endpoints
1. **POST /api/log-conversation**: Store chat messages as vector embeddings
2. **GET /api/search-memory**: Search for similar conversations using vector similarity
3. **GET /api/status**: Health check and configuration status

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Main admin interface with status monitoring
- **ConversationLogger**: Interface for testing conversation logging
- **MemorySearch**: Interface for testing memory search functionality
- **APIDocumentation**: Built-in documentation for API endpoints
- **ServerLogs**: Real-time server activity monitoring

## Data Flow

1. **Conversation Logging**:
   - User submits chat messages through the admin interface
   - Server combines messages into a single text string
   - OpenAI API generates embeddings for the text
   - Embeddings and metadata are stored in both PostgreSQL and Pinecone

2. **Memory Search**:
   - User enters a search query
   - Server generates embeddings for the query using OpenAI
   - Pinecone performs vector similarity search
   - Results are returned with similarity scores and metadata

3. **Data Storage**:
   - PostgreSQL stores the full conversation data and metadata
   - Pinecone stores vector embeddings for fast similarity search
   - Both systems are kept in sync for each memory entry

## External Dependencies

### Required Services
- **OpenAI API**: For generating text embeddings (text-embedding-3-large model, 3072 dimensions)
